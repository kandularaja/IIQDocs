Permitted roles: (Optional)
Permitted relationships mean the access is discretionary – these are
permissions or entitlements a user may be allowed to have, but isn’t
required to have. When permitted access is included with a business role,
the entitlements are essentially “pre-screened” – we know that a user
with this role is allowed to have the permitted access. For example,
perhaps all employees are allowed to have VPN access but aren’t
automatically given this access unless they or their manager requests it.
